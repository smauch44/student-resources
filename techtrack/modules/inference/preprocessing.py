        """
        Captures frames from a video file and yields every nth frame.

        :return: A generator yielding frames as NumPy arrays.

        **Functionality:**
        - Opens a video file using OpenCV.
        - Iterates through each frame.
        - Yields every `drop_rate`-th frame.
        - Releases the video resource when finished.

        **Usage Example:**
        ```python
        video_processor = Preprocessing("video.mp4", drop_rate=10)
        for frame in video_processor.capture_video():
            process_frame(frame)  # Custom processing function (...think Detector Methods!)
        ```
