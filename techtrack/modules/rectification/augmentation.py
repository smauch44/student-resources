class Augmenter:
    """
    A collection of dataset augmentation methods including transformations, 
    blurring, resizing, and brightness adjustments. 

    NOTE: This class is used to transform data necessary for training TechTrack's models.
          Imagine that the output of `self.transform()` is fed directly to train the model.
    
    The following transformations are included:
    - Horizontal flipping: i.e., def horizontal_flip(**kwargs)
    - Gaussian blurring: i.e., def gaussian_blur_image(**kwargs)
    - Resizing: i.e., def resize(**kwargs)
    - Brightness and contrast adjustments: i.e., def change_brightness(**kwargs)
        - HINT: you may use cv2.addWeighted()

    NOTE: These methods uses **kwargs to accept arbitrary keyword arguments,
    but explicit parameter definitions improve clarity and usability.
    - "**kwargs" reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/args-kwargs-python/

    Finally, Provide a demonstration and visualizations of these methods in `notebooks/augmentation.ipynb`.
    You will define your own keywords for "**kwargs".

    ## TASK 1: Complete the five augmenter class methods. 
    #          - This class is used to transform data necessary for training TechTrack's models.
    #          - Imagine that the output of `self.transform()` is fed directly to train the model.
    #          - You will define your own keywords for "**kwargs".
    #          --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #          Create your own augmentation method. Use the same structure as the format used below.
    #          For example,
    #
    #          def your_custom_transformation(**kwargs):
    #              # your process
    #              return ...
    #
    #          Name this method appropriately based on its capability. And add docstrings to 
    #          describe its process.
    #          --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #          Provide a demonstration and visualizations of these methods in
