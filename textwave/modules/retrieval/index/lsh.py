class FaissLSH:
    """
    An LSH-based FAISS index for storing embeddings and their associated metadata.
    
    This class uses Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to build an approximate nearest neighbor index.
    LSH works by hashing input vectors into buckets such that similar vectors are likely to hash to the same bucket.
    This reduces the search space significantly compared to brute-force search, making it especially effective for large datasets.
    However, note that because the method is approximate, the search results might not always be perfectly accurate.
    
    Attributes:
        dim (int): The dimensionality of the embeddings.
        metadata (list): A list to store metadata corresponding to each embedding.
        index (faiss.IndexLSH): A FAISS LSH index initialized with the specified embedding dimension and number of bits.
    """

    def __init__(self, dim, nbits=128):
        """
        Initializes the FaissLSH index.
        
        This method sets up internal storage for embeddings and metadata and creates a FAISS LSH index.
        The LSH algorithm reduces the search space by hashing vectors into buckets using random projections.
        Similar vectors are likely to hash to the same bucket, so searching within buckets is more efficient than 
        comparing every vector in the dataset.
        
        Parameters:
            dim (int): The dimensionality of the embeddings.
            **kwargs: Optional keyword arguments to configure the LSH index. Recognized keys include:
                      - nbits (int): The number of bits to use for hashing in the LSH index.
                        A higher number of bits generally provides finer-grained buckets, which may improve accuracy
                        but at the cost of increased memory usage and slower search times. Default is 128.

    def add_embeddings(self, embeddings, metadata):

        Adds new embeddings and their associated metadata to the index.
        
        The embeddings are added both to the FAISS LSH index and the internal metadata list.
        Since LSH relies on hashing, each embedding is projected into a binary hash code; 
        during a search, the index quickly narrows down potential candidates based on hash collisions.
        
        Parameters:
            embeddings (list or np.ndarray): A list of embeddings, where each embedding is an array-like
                of length `dim`.
            metadata (list): A list of metadata corresponding to each embedding.
